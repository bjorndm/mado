#ã€€What does GLFW mean to Mado?

For Mado, GLFW is the original purpose of development, a reference, and ultimately a competitor that must be overcome.

GLFW has had a critical problem for many years with the lack of input support for CJK (Chinese, Japanese Korean) languages, and has not shown any improvement from 2015 to March 2024.

They claim that this issue will be resolved by the release of GLFW-2.5, but I know this is not possible.
This is because the contributions of the [clear-node/glfw](https://github.com/clear-code/glfw) team, which has been trying to add IME support to glfw for many years, are also incomplete.

## Problems with IME products of clear-node/glfw

I have previously tried implementing [Fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne)'s IME support using clear-node/glfw.
At that time, I faced many problems and realized that I could not solve them this way.

### Does not support MS-Windows windowed rendering.

Direct3D/OpenGL has Full screen Mode and Windowed Mode, and in Full screen Mode, the application must perform all drawing, including drawing the IME, so their implementation is correct.

However, for most other uses, including original toolkits, applications and the OS work together to support IME. In other words, the IME application provided by OS is drawn with the coordinates superimposed on the application window. clear-node/glfw cannot make any assumptions about this style.

### Incomplete support for MacOS

Their implementation cannot receive IME ON-Off events.
More precisely, their events are redundant, and turning the IME ON once will cause the IME ON event to be clicked 8 times.

### Incomplete support for Linux X11

An event is not issued when the IME is turned on. This event is an important moment for applications to specify what coordinates the IME text cursor should be at, and it is difficult to implement IME support without this event. Strictly speaking, the preedit text timing is altanative, but since the preedit text event is issued every time the user inputs text through the IME, it would be excessive timing to consider the coordinate calculation of the IME text cursor. IME Window Redrawing is a fairly expensive calculation.

### Not at all for Linux Wayland

Wayland's text input is not considered at all.

So, I have decided that it is impossible to continue to maintain the glfw/glfw implementation with the aim of improving it, including the many problems with the X11 event handler implementation.

## GIOUI

I considered alternatives to solving this problem and ultimately decided that [gioui](https://github.com/gioui/gio) was the most appropriate starting point.

- Window support for Windows, Mac, Linux X11, Linux Wayland, Android, iOS
- Support for OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Vulcan, Metal, Direct3D11
- Have a high level of IME support in each environment
- Without GLFW and has a large proportion of Go code
